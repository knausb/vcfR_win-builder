# vcfR_win-builder
Precompiled binary of vcfR for Windows users

Some Windows users may not want to try to compile the source for vcfR.
For these people I have provided this precompiled binary.
Download it to a local directory, open R and use the following command to install.

    install.packages("./vcfR_0.1.zip", repos = NULL)


This example assumes the *.zip archive is in your working directory.
